# MangaRipper

CI: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/NguyenDanPhuong/mangaripper

I wrote MangaRipper in 2011, 1 year after I've worked as software engineer, to learn about OO programing and design patterns.

This software helps you download manga (Japanese Comic) from several websites for your offline viewing.

I uploaded its source code to CodePlex and don't touch it since then.

Today I interested into it again. And reupload it to Github to continuing development.
